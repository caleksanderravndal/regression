# Regression capstone - Predicting Daily Electricity Consumption in Norway

## Project Overview
This project investigates whether daily electricity consumption in Norway can be predicted using weather, seasonality, and lagged demand features. The work was completed as part of a capstone project in the [BSc Artificial Intelligence and Sustainable Technologies] program.

**Problem Framing:**  
Accurate forecasting supports sustainable hydropower reservoir management, grid stability, and reduced reliance on imports.  

**Hypothesis vs Findings:**  
The initial hypothesis assumed that electricity consumption could be predicted primarily from weather and seasonality.  
Results disproved this: lagged demand features (yesterdayâ€™s and last weekâ€™s consumption) were far more important.

## Key results
- Weather + Seasonality only â†’ poor performance (negative RÂ²).  
- Lags only â†’ strong performance, test RÂ² â‰ˆ **0.92**.  
- Full model â†’ Ridge Regression (Î±=1000) confirmed as the most robust model.  
- Random Forest consistently overfit, with weaker generalization.

## Context and impact
- **Climate trends:** Recent years show **colder summers and milder winters**, weakening traditional seasonal patterns.  
- **Electrification:** Norway leads the world in EV adoption (over 80% of new cars sold are electric), contributing to high but relatively stable demand.  
- These structural changes explain why lag features dominate short-term prediction.

## Workflow
1. **Data Preparation**  
   - [ENTSO-E Transparency Platform](https://transparency.entsoe.eu/): daily total load (2015â€“2025)  
   - [Norwegian Meteorological Institute](https://thredds.met.no/thredds/catalog/senorge/seNorge_2018/Archive/catalog.html): daily weather (temperature, precipitation)  

2. **EDA**  
   - Weak correlation between weather and consumption  
   - Seasonal decomposition shows yearly cycles, but less pronounced winter peaks  

3. **Modeling**  
   - Setup 1: Weather + Seasonality â†’ failed (negative RÂ²)  
   - Setup 2: Lags only â†’ strong (RÂ² â‰ˆ 0.92)  
   - Setup 3: Full model â†’ Ridge best balance  

4. **Optimization**  
   - Ridge regularization stabilized coefficients (Î±=1000)  
   - Random Forest tuning reduced overfitting but remained weaker than Ridge  

5. **Diagnostics**  
   - Residual plots confirmed unbiased errors and good generalization

## ðŸ“ˆ Final Model
- **Model:** Ridge Regression  
- **Test RÂ²:** 0.92  
- **Key drivers:** Lag features (yesterday, last week)  
- **Interpretation:** Persistence dominates short-term electricity demand, while weather and seasonality play a minor role.
